// The app's breakpoints, in one place.
//
// There were four, uncoordinated: 1024, 768, 640 and 400. 640 carried exactly
// two rules — the modal going full-bleed and the music player going
// edge-to-edge — and both are "this is a phone" decisions that the rest of the
// app already spells 768 (the SecurityBoard modal goes full-bleed at 768, six
// lines of CSS away from the one that did it at 640, so the app had two
// different widths for the same idea). 640 is gone; three remain, and each one
// now means something you can say in a sentence:
//
//   wide   1024  the top bar can no longer hold the links; they move to the drawer
//   phone   768  one-column layouts, 16px controls, safe-area gutters
//   narrow  400  the last squeeze: smaller wordmark, tighter page padding
//
// CSS custom properties cannot be used inside @media, so styles.css still
// writes the numbers literally — but it writes them under a comment pointing
// here, and every one of them is one of these three. This module is the source
// for JS; `--bp-*` in :root is the source a devtools inspection can read.

// added and removed the listener by hand, beside two more bare matchMedia
// reads; all four call sites are this module now.
