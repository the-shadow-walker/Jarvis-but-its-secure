# Boot the disposable guest: a qcow2 overlay on the read-only golden image, under
# KVM, with a vhost-vsock channel to the host and NO network device at all. The
# guest's only path off-box is vsock to the host gateway (CID 2). All guest writes
# land in the throwaway overlay; the golden base is never touched.
#
# This is the proven aarch64/KVM invocation from the old sandbox layer with the
# tap NIC removed and `-device vhost-vsock-pci` added. Normally launched by
# backend/vm/lifecycle.py (app-owned subprocess); runnable by hand for a boot test.
