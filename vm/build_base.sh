# Build the versioned golden guest image for Jarvis's sandbox VM.
#
# Flow (proven on this Pi in the pre-prune sandbox layer, trimmed for vsock):
#   download Debian 13 genericcloud arm64 cloud image -> verify SHA512
#   -> cloud-init seed -> boot once (SLIRP net) to provision -> poweroff
#   -> freeze as read-only base-v<N>.qcow2.
#
# The guest gets NO SSH server and NO runtime network: its only path off-box is
# an AF_VSOCK channel to the host gateway. cloud-init bakes the Phase-2 self-test
# stub (guest_agent.py) + a boot unit that runs it. Rebuild bumps VERSION; the
# script refuses to clobber an existing base image.
