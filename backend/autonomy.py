"""Per-project autonomy dial — how much the agent may do unattended.

Four levels, increasing capability:

  read_only  only observe (read files, search, browse the web)
  stage      + file writes (live — the quarantine is gone; writes are
             advisory-scanned and git is the undo surface)
  gated      + spawn agents/research
  full       + propose git commits (the current, unrestricted default)

A project with no setting is `full` — so this is opt-in and never regresses
existing behavior. Enforcement is an **allowlist**: `read_only` exposes only the
explicit read set, and any tool we don't recognise defaults to `full`-only, so a
new or unknown tool is never accidentally handed to a restricted project.

This dial only narrows which tools the model is even offered on a turn; the
durable boundaries (write scans, commit approval) enforce independently.
