"""Tool/skill registry: markdown + YAML frontmatter compiled to registry.json.

A tool is a FOLDER: tools/<name>/TOOL.md + tools/<name>/handler.py. That is
the entire contract for adding one — drop the folder in, it appears in the
Tools tab, flip `enabled: true` to grant it. (This is also the seam through
which Jarvis will one day author its own tools: two staged files + operator
approval.)

TOOL.md frontmatter:

    ---
    name: web_search
    description: Search the web via SearXNG.
    when_to_use: When the answer needs live information.
    enabled: false
    parameters:            # JSON schema for the arguments
      type: object
      properties: {...}
    ---
    (body = references / examples for the model)

handler.py must define `async def run(**args) -> str`. Skills are compiled into
the same registry from skills/<name>/SKILL.md. A registry entry without a
handler is surfaced to the model but fails loudly if called — that mismatch is
a bug we want to see.
