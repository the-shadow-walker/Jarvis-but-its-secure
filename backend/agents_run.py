"""Running an agent = a ReAct turn with the agent's own system prompt and a
tool set trimmed by its exclusions, streamed and persisted like a chat so the
run is findable afterward. This is the concrete implementation behind the
Agents tab's definitions; the operator kicks one off from the project board.

The agent runs in the ACTIVE PROJECT: it gets the project's assembled context
(minus any context items the agent excludes) and the same staged-write tools,
so its file changes land in the approval queue exactly like Jarvis's own.
