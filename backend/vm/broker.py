"""Host tool broker for guest-run turns.

The guest loop can't run host-brokered tools itself — it sends a `tool_broker_call`
over vsock and the host runs it HERE, behind every existing gate. This is a THIN
pass-through to `registry.dispatch` (it never reimplements tool logic), so the
write scans, git-commit approval, SSRF guard, and secret substitution stay
authoritative host-side. It is also the single chokepoint every guest tool call
crosses — the natural home for the tier-4 controls. Their hook points are marked
below (pre-dispatch policy / diff-gate; post-dispatch taint stamp / scrub) so they
slot in without reshaping the protocol.

The turn's context envelope is registered host-side by op_id (register_turn) and
resolved here — the guest never carries it, so a compromised guest can't forge
active_project / web_session / ephemeral.

# --- op_id capability tokens -------------------------------------------------
# An op_id names a turn; it does not PROVE one. They are deterministic
# (`chat:{cid}`, `guest:{cid}`), the guest supplies its own in every request,
# and one guest legitimately runs several turns at once — so a compromised
# guest holds a few real op_ids and can count to the rest. Presenting somebody
# else's made the gateway serve it: `broker_dispatch` restored the victim's
# envelope and the caller then acted as that turn, with its project pin, its
# web session, its artifact store and its Budget.
#
# The fix is a per-turn secret minted host-side, shipped once in the turn spec,
# and required on every request alongside the op_id. Binding to the CONNECTION
# instead does not work here: the guest opens a fresh short-lived vsock
# connection per model/tool call, and several concurrent turns in one guest
# share both the gateway and the guest's CID, so there is nothing about a
# connection that distinguishes them. The token is what does — it lives in the
# guest's per-turn `turnctx`, the same task-local that already keeps concurrent
# turns' op_ids apart.
#
# Honest limit: this stops op_id GUESSING, not a guest that can read another
# concurrent turn's task-local state. Anything with that reach already had the
# victim's op_id too, so the token does not make that case worse — it removes
# the case where no reach at all was needed.

    swallowed by a broadened except in the gateway.
