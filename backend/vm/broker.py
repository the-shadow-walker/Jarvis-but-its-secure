"""Host tool broker for guest-run turns.

The guest loop can't run host-brokered tools itself — it sends a `tool_broker_call`
over vsock and the host runs it HERE, behind every existing gate. This is a THIN
pass-through to `registry.dispatch` (it never reimplements tool logic), so the
write scans, git-commit approval, SSRF guard, and secret substitution stay
authoritative host-side. It is also the single chokepoint every guest tool call
crosses — the natural home for the tier-4 controls. Their hook points are marked
below (pre-dispatch policy / diff-gate; post-dispatch taint stamp / scrub) so they
slot in without reshaping the protocol.

The turn's context envelope is registered host-side by op_id (register_turn) and
resolved here — the guest never carries it, so a compromised guest can't forge
active_project / web_session / ephemeral.
