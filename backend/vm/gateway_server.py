"""Host-side AF_VSOCK model gateway — the only thing the guest can reach.

The guest has no network device. Its one path off-box is a vsock stream to the
host (CID 2) on settings.vm_vsock_port, over which it speaks newline-delimited
JSON. Each `model_call` request is metered on the host by the guest-supplied
op_id (registered here so `budget.get(op_id)` resolves it — the connection lands
on THIS server's task, not the turn's, so contextvar propagation wouldn't reach
it; the Phase-1 op_id keying is exactly what makes this work) and answered by
streaming `model.complete`'s events straight back. The DeepSeek key stays host-
side and never crosses the boundary.

Phase 2 handles `model_call` (+ `ping`). Phase 3 adds tool-broker ops here.
