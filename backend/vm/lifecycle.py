"""App-owned lifecycle for the disposable guest VM.

The FastAPI app boots QEMU as a subprocess in its own process group (so teardown
kills the whole tree), running a qcow2 overlay on the read-only golden image with
a vhost-vsock channel and NO network device. A guest dies with the app — fine, it
is disposable; nothing durable lives inside. No systemd (that was the old
persistent model); the app owns the guest, which is the path to the per-turn /
pooled guests of Phase 3.
