"""One entry point the loop callers share, so where the loop runs is decided in
one place rather than five bespoke wirings.

`run_agent_turn` has `run_turn`'s exact event contract (yields token / tool /
tool_result / final) and its persistence hook (`on_tool_call`). It runs the loop
in the guest via `guest_turn`: it builds the turn's context envelope from the
ambient runtime contextvars the caller already set (web_session / ephemeral /
event_chan / artifact_slug), and pairs the guest's tool + tool_result events to
feed `on_tool_call` (the guest loop carries no db handle, so the host sink runs
here). The host-side fallback is gone (M4e, 2026-08-02) — the guest loop had
soaked since 07-15 without ever needing it, and two live paths meant knobs kept
being threaded into one and silently dropped by the other.

Nesting: if a Budget is already in scope we are inside an operation (e.g. a
brokered spawn_agent running under a guest chat) — the turn then shares that
operation's guest + Budget and does NOT re-push the workspace (its parent already
did; re-pushing would wipe the parent's in-flight staged edits). A top-level turn
pushes a fresh workspace and its edits reconcile at turn end.
