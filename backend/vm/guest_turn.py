"""Host-side driver for a turn that runs INSIDE the guest.

Same event contract as `run_turn` (yields token / tool / tool_result / final), so
a caller swaps `run_turn(...)` for `guest_turn(...)`. It resolves the rules +
config host-side, registers the op_id budget, connects to the guest's run-turn
server over vsock (host -> guest, the guest's CID), ships the turn spec, and
re-yields the guest's streamed events. The loop's own model calls dial back to
the host gateway (guest -> host); the op_id ties both to one host-side budget.

M1 runs no-tools turns; M2 adds tool_specs + host tool-brokering + tool-call
persistence reconstructed here from the tool/tool_result events.

    `envelope` (a broker.TurnEnvelope) is registered host-side by op_id for the
    turn's tool_broker_calls; the guest never carries it.

    `active_slug` is the project the guest's in-guest file tools operate on.

    write buffer coming home at turn end — set for a TOP-LEVEL turn. A NESTED
    turn (spawn_agent/deploy_agents child) leaves it False: it reuses the copy its

    parent's turn-end pack. Among CONCURRENT top-level turns on one slug, only
    the first actually ships a copy (see _ws_holds above); the last one out
    sweeps the shared buffer.

    A nested turn passes an op_id already carrying the operation's Budget; a
